Customify is a Theme Customizer Booster that you can easily use to add Fonts, Colors, Live CSS Editor and other options to your theme.

== Description ==

With Customify, developers can easily create advanced theme-specific options inside the WordPress Customizer. Using those options, a user can make presentational changes without having to know or edit the theme code.

=Types of Fields=

*Color*
A color picker used to control any text or background color of an element.

*Typography*
A series of typographic options that allow you to access the massive **Google Fonts library** and make them available inside your theme customizer.

*CSS Editor*
A powerful **Live CSS Editor** directly into your customizer! Useful for better control over the appearance of your theme without the need to create a child theme or worry about theme updates overwriting your customizations.

*Text Field*
A simple text field that allows you to customize elements like Site Title or Footer Credits.

*Select Dropdown*
A drop-down menu selector to be used when you have to choose from multiple options.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pixcustomify.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to ‘Appearance -> Customize’ menu and have fun with the new fields
