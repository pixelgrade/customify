Customify is a theme Customizer booster to easily customize Fonts, Colors, and other options for a certain WordPress theme.

== Description ==

With [Customify](https://github.com/pixelgrade/customify), developers can easily create **advanced theme-specific options** inside the WordPress Customizer. Using those options, a user can make presentational changes without having to know or edit the theme code.

This plugin is **primarily intended** to be used together with [Pixelgrade themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/author/pixelgrade/). So the best way to get acquainted with it's capabilities is to study the way [one of Pixelgrade's themes](https://github.com/pixelgrade/rosa2-lite/tree/master/inc/integrations/customify) integrates with it.

**Made with care by Pixelgrade**
